Moondream is an open-source visual language model.
With under 2B parameters. Quantized to 4-bit. Just 1GB. Moondream runs anywhere â€” from edge devices to your laptop.

I have tested it with several text props to see how well it can return a bounding box of the item mentioned in the promp.
See <prompt's>.jpg for results.
